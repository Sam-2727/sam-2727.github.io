# Sam Christian

I'm a graduate student studying physics at Harvard University. 

I'm broadly interested in understanding quantum field theory, gravity, and string theory. Right now, I'm researching numerical aspects of string scattering amplitudes and the formalization of string theory as a quantum field theory ("string field theory"). I'm always trying to learn more about the (known aspects of) structure of string theory more generally.

Check out my [physics notes](/blog) for the most current things I'm thinking about.

Occasionally, I write [physics notes](/blog) that I think others in my field will find useful. I hope to write more generally accessible write-ups at some point.
